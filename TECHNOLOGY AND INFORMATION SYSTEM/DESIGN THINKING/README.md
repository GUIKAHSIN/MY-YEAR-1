## ðŸ’¡Reflection
<p align= "justify">
In my perspective, the design thinking assignment immensely enhanced my acumen in critical and creative thinking. The process of empathizing, defining problems, ideating, prototyping, and testing demanded a critical evaluation of each phase, encouraging me to analyze information and delve deeper into issues to solve the problems. It has significantly honed my critical thinking skills and preserved my time, enabling a systematic and analytical approach to problem-solving. The assignment fostered creativity by motivating "thinking outside the box" and the exploration of unusual solutions. It emphasizes the ability to think creatively about addressing problems' requirements and solving them from a fresh perspective. Consequently, mastering my critical thinking ability and nurturing my innovation is my main priority and something I ought to improve. I can therefore comprehend and approach problems gradually after strengthening these skills.
