## ðŸ’¡Reflection

<h3>ðŸ“°Assignment 4 (Format: Technical Paper IEEE) </h3>
<p align= "justify">
Technology innovation has changed human day-to-day life. I was impressed by the evolution of the computing science field, which has rapidly enhanced the standard of living after the visits. I was also surprised by Petronasâ€™s technology because I realised it was much more than just an oil and gas company after listening to Mr. Ninderjit Singhâ€™s speech. It needs advanced technology to support the companyâ€™s operation, its smart alarm system provides early warning and real-time monitoring to ensure a reliable supply of power. Besides, I was thrilled to see the weighing retail scale at Huawei CSIC since I had previously read about the news of this similar technology at Amazon. It is more convenient for both the seller and the customer due to the shorter payment period, the long queue scenario could be reduced. Lastly, the motivation that I gained from this industrial visit was, â€˜Never stop learning as there is no limit to knowledge.â€™ from Mr. Roman Kvaska. I also believe that innovation is the purpose of humans nowadays working together to create a lasting future in every aspect.

  - In order to enhance my understanding of the industrial visits, I intend to engage in talks and workshops about computing science and various technological applications. My understanding will be further enhanced by looking for more information about ongoing innovation initiatives and by investigating practical experiences in technology-driven environments. This dedication is consistent with the drive to always learn new things, which promotes flexibility in the ever-changing technological environment.
