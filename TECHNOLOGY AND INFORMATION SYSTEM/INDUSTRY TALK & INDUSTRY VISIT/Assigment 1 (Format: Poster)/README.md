This discussion on career paths has inspired me to fully commit to my academic pursuits, aiming to eventually join PPG. The distinctive and friendly atmosphere among colleagues at PPG is something I aspire to be a part of and experience. Recognizing that the ICT field is a growing trend and will continue to be intricately woven into various aspects of our lives, I am driven by a newfound curiosity to explore this field and acquire diverse knowledge. I am thankful for the opportunity to attend these career talks, and I aspire to contribute meaningfully to the ICT field using the knowledge gained from university. I am dedicated to intensifying my efforts, aspiring to follow in the footsteps of the presenters, and ultimately becoming a valuable part of the ICT industry.
