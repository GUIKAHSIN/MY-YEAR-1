## Couse Information üñ•Ô∏èüî¢

<p align="justify">
This course serves as an introduction to the fundamental principles and applications of discrete structures within the field of computer science. Topics covered include set theory, proof techniques, relations, functions, recurrence relations, counting methods, graph theory, trees, and finite automata. By the course's conclusion, we are expected to apply set theory, relations, and functions to solve computer science problems, analyze and solve problems utilizing recurrence relations and counting methods, apply graph theory and trees to real-world problems, and employ deterministic finite automata (finite state machines) for modeling electronic devices and problem-solving in various contexts.
